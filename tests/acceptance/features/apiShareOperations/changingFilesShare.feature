Feature: sharing

  Background:
    Given using OCS API version "1"
    And using old DAV path
    And these users have been created with default attributes and skeleton files:
      | username |
      | user0    |
      | user1    |

  @smokeTest
  Scenario: moving a file into a share as recipient
    Given user "user0" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "user0" has shared folder "/shared" with user "user1"
    When user "user1" moves file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/shared_file.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then as "user1" file "/shared/shared_file.txt" should exist
    And as "user0" file "/shared/shared_file.txt" should exist

  @smokeTest @files_trashbin-app-required
  Scenario: moving a file out of a share as recipient creates a backup for the owner
    Given user "user0" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "user0" has moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/shared_file.txt"
    And user "user0" has shared file "/shared" with user "user1"
    And user "user1" has moved folder "/shared" to "/shared_renamed"
    When user "user1" moves file "/shared_renamed/shared_file.txt" to "/taken_out.txt" using the WebDAV API
    Then as "user1" file "/taken_out.txt" should exist
    And as "user0" file "/shared/shared_file.txt" should not exist
    And as "user0" file "/shared_file.txt" should exist in trash

  @files_trashbin-app-required
  Scenario: moving a folder out of a share as recipient creates a backup for the owner
    Given user "user0" has created folder "/shared"
    And user "user0" has created folder "/shared/sub"
    And user "user0" has moved file "/textfile0.txt" to "/shared/sub/shared_file.txt"
    And user "user0" has shared file "/shared" with user "user1"
    And user "user1" has moved folder "/shared" to "/shared_renamed"
    When user "user1" moves folder "/shared_renamed/sub" to "/taken_out" using the WebDAV API
    Then as "user1" file "/taken_out" should exist
    And as "user0" folder "/shared/sub" should not exist
    And as "user0" folder "/sub" should exist in trash
    And as "user0" file "/sub/shared_file.txt" should exist in trash

  @public_link_share-feature-required
  Scenario Outline: Public can delete file through publicly shared link having delete permissions
    Given using OCS API version "<ocs_api_version>"
    And user "user0" has moved file "welcome.txt" to "PARENT/welcome.txt"
    When user "user0" creates a public link share using the sharing API with settings
      | path        | /PARENT       |
      | permissions | <permissions> |
    And the public deletes file "welcome.txt" from the last public share using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "<http-status-code>"
    And as "user0" file "PARENT/welcome.txt" <should-or-not> exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version | permissions               | http-status-code | should-or-not |
      | 1               | read,update,create        | 403              | should        |
      | 2               | read,update,create        | 403              | should        |
      | 1               | read,update,create,delete | 204              | should not    |
      | 2               | read,update,create,delete | 204              | should not    |

      | permissions | read,update,create |
    And the public renames file "parent.txt" to "newparent.txt" from the last public share using the public WebDAV API
    Then the HTTP status code should be "403"
    And as "user0" file "/PARENT/parent.txt" should exist
    And as "user0" file "/PARENT/newparent.txt" should not exist
    Examples:
      | ocs_api_version |
